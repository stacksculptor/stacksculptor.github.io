Front end developer portfolio with 3d visuals
Hi!
Following code is my portfolio website. To build this i used react, vite, threejs, taliwind and 3d models.
I also used emailjs so that the contact form on the bottom of the page sends emails to me. Feel free to rewiev this and give me any advice, or to contact me for a job!
